Ajax:
allows databse change without reloading the page (for something small). Change orderline expand to ajax?
ajax call to status change dropdown
jquery.get(), jquery.post(), jquery.getJSON() (getting the JSON data is better)
    need a handler if request fails/gets bad data (.done, .fail, .always)

Debugging:
have console/debugger open when running js and it'll highlight and stop on the failed line
callstack: shows all functions that were called to get to the place you are rn
event listener: in chrome, can find all events called on page

cookies:
set up csrfmiddlewear in settings in django.
    maybe throw in later, not suuuuper necessary

ipdp:
debug in python
import ipdp; ipdp.set_trace()
